      <h1>Common Form</h1>
      <p>an open repository of legal forms</p>

      <h2>Permanence</h2>
      <p>As a general rule, once a form gets published on commonform.org, it stays there and does not change.  In other words, the form <em>will not be deleted</em> and its substantive content <em>will not change</em>.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this policy is to allow others to link to, cite, and incorporate every form on commonform.org by reference.  If forms could change willy-nilly, without warning, no competent counselor would do that.</p>
      <p>As an example, <a href=/kemitchell>kemitchell</a> will not delete <a href="/kemitchell/fairshake/1e1u">his Fairshake form, first edition, first update</a> from commonform.org.  Its address will work as a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink>permalink</a>.  Its substantive content, starting from its preamble and ending with its definition of “New Intellectual Property”, will not change.</p>
      <p>When <a href=/kemitchell>kemitchell</a> finds ways to improve his form, or even spots errors in it, there will be <a href=/kemitchell/fairshake>new editions of the Fairshake form</a>.  The first edition, first update will not change.  If and when he becomes embarassed by that early edition in the future, tough luck.  He will publish something new and better, not purge his prior handiwork from Common Form history.</p>

      <p>Top Tip!  Those who want extra double super protection should consider archiving copies of commonform.org webpages, or using a third-party service like <a href=https://archive.org>The Internet Archive</a> or <a href=https://perma.cc>Perma.cc</a> to do so for them.  By the by, commonform.org’s source files are acceded to the <a href=https://archiveprogram.github.com/>GitHub Archive Program</a>, in case you get <em>really</em> desperate.</p>
      <p>Since commonform.org inhabits the real world, there have to be a few exceptions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The formatting, styling, typography, and other user interface elements of form pages will change. The plan is that they will get better.  The people behind commonform.org will do their best to avoid any confusion about what is the text of the form on that page, and what is other, potentially changeable content.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The special <a href=/kemitchell/fairshake/1e1u.md>markup</a> that forms are originally written in may change, as may the way that markup gets turned into webpages, Word files, and the rest.  Please avoid relying on formatting happenstances, like page numbers or font choices.  Cite specific definitions by name and specific sections by heading.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If we have to take forms down to avoid legal claims, or to comply with the law, we will.  For example, we may take forms down under the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act>Digital Millenium Copyright Act</a> or to avoid getting roped into somebody else’s trademark suit.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since we are but mortals, there will ablso be exceptions we haven’t though of yet.  We will do our best to put them here when we do.</p>
