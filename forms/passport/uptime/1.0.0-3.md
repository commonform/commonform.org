# Ensure Service Levels

## Service-Level Agreement

So long as _Customer_'s use of the _Service_ remains within the _Use Limits_, _Provider_ agrees to host the _Service_ with _Uptime_ of no less than the **Uptime Commitment** listed on the _Rider_. If the _Rider_ does not say, the _Uptime Commitment_ is 99.9%.

## Give Credits for Low Uptime

_Provider_ agrees to credit _Customer_'s account on _Notice_ and verification that _Provider_ failed to provide service according to [Service-Level Agreement](#service-level-agrfeement) in the current _Billing Period_ or any of the three prior _Billing Periods_, according to the _Rider_. If the _Rider_ does not say, _Provider_ agrees to credit _Customer_'s account:

- 5% of _Fees_ for any _Billing Period_ with _Uptime_ between zero and one percentage point less than the _Uptime Commitment_

- 10% of _Fees_ for any _Billing Period_ with _Uptime_ between one and two percentage points less than the _Uptime Commitment_

- 25% of _Fees_ for any _Billing Period_ with _Uptime_ at or below three percentage points less than the _Uptime Commitment_

## Apply Credits

_Provider_ agrees to apply credits under [Give Credits for Low Uptime](#give-credits-for-law-uptime) against _Customer_'s obligations to pay _Fees_ as soon as possible. _Provider_ does not agree to refund any credits.

## Refund Fees for Low Uptime

If _Provider_ credits _Customer_'s account under [Give Credits for Low Uptime](#give-credits-for-law-uptime) for three _Billing Periods_ in a row, and _Customer_ ends this agreement at the end of those _Billing Periods_, citing low _Uptime_, _Provider_ agrees to refund all _Fees_ that _Customer_ paid for the three _Billing Periods_, as well as any _Prepaid Fees_.

# Agreed Legal Remedy

_Customer_'s only legal remedies for failures to meet [Service-Level Agreement](#service-level-agreement) will be credits under [Give Credits for Low Uptime](#give-credits-for-low-uptime) and refunds under [Refund Fees for Low Uptime](#refund-fees-for-low-uptime).
