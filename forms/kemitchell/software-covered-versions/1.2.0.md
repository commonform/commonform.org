**Covered Versions** depend on the _Order Form_:

- If the _Order Form_ specifies a particular version, _Covered Versions_ include only that version.

- If the _Order Form_ specifies a version range, such as "1.y.z", then _Covered Versions_ include the latest _Generally Available_ version in that range on the date of this agreement, as well as any new versions within that range that _Vendor_ makes _Generally Available_ during the term of this agreement.

- If the _Order Form_ does not specify a particular version or version range, then _Covered Versions_ include the latest _Generally Available_ version on the date of this agreement, as well as any new versions that _Vendor_ makes _Generally Available_ during the term of this agreement.

- A version of the _Software_ is **Generally Available** if _Vendor_ offers to the public for use in production systems. Versions that _Vendor_ designates with labels like "Alpha", "Beta", "Preview", "Testing", and "Preview" are not _Generally Available_.
