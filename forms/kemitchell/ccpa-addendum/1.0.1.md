**Provider** and **Customer** agree to add the following terms to their **Agreement**:

# Compliance

Both sides agree to do their respective parts to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act and its regulations, consistent with _Provider_'s role as a "service provider", and not as a "third party", under that law.

# Cooperation

Whenever it is feasible and legal to do so, each side will give the other prompt notice of user rights requests, regulatory inquiries, and other communications under the California Consumer Privacy Act according to the notice provisions of the _Agreement_. Both sides agree to cooperate in good faith to respond to and honor such communications, and to meet other obligations under the California Consumer Privacy Act.

# Prohibitions

_Provider_ may not:

- sell personal information collected from consumers covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act that _Customer_ discloses to _Provider_

- retain, use, or disclose such information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the services specified in the contract, including retaining, using, or disclosing such information for a commercial purpose other than providing the services specified in the contract

- retain, use, or disclose such information outside of the direct business relationship between _Provider_ and _Customer_

# Certification

_Provider_ certifies that _Provider_ understands the restrictions in [Prohibitions](#prohibitions) and will comply with them.

# Minimization

Both sides agree to limit use of personal information covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act to that reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose of the _Agreement_, consistent with the meaning of "business purpose" under that law.

# Subcontracting

_Provider_ agrees to ensure that each subcontractor that processes _Customer_ information covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act will also qualify as a "service provider", and not as a "third party", under that law.

# Conflicts

If the terms of this addendum conflict with terms of the _Agreement_, the terms of this addendum take precedence.
